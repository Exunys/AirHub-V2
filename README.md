# ℹ️  Information
This is a universal script that features an Aimbot, Wall Hack (ESP) and a Crosshair. The customizability of this script makes it stand out from other free scripts some of which **have annoying key systems**. This project is completely free, adless and open sourced.

This script is an entirely renewed version of the [old AirHub script](https://github.com/Exunys/AirHub). 

It uses an entirely new [CS:GO-Styled ESP Module](https://github.com/Exunys/Exunys-ESP) which has been hardly worked on and pushed to perfection. It also uses an upgraded version of [Exunys's old Aimbot V2 script](https://github.com/Exunys/Aimbot-V3) which goes by [Aimbot V3](https://github.com/Exunys/Aimbot-V3) for the Aimbot.

The UI Library that this script uses is a forked version of [vozoid's](https://github.com/vozoid) UI Library customized specifically for AirHub V2's standards to give the user a premium exploiting experience.

Press ***Right Shift*** to open/close the GUI. You can also change this key by opening the settings tab and by navigating to the *Settings* section that is located at the top left side of the GUI.
